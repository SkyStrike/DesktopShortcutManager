# DesktopShortcutManager

A small program which does shortcuts management. This is specially created for people who hates having too many shortcuts on the desktop.

Previously this was written in .NET 2.0 in 2011. I've not been updating this program since then. But I've recently updated it to .NET 4.0. 
Which includes a couple of features which I think was lacking previously (Was working for me all these while).

The port from 2.0 to 4.0 includes some code cleanup and organizing. Nothing major.
